# PLD_Project ðŸŽ“

This repository contains the project for the **Programming Language Design** course at the Faculty of Computers and Information Sciences (FCIS), Mansoura University.

This project implements a **custom parser and interpreter** for a simplified high-level programming language designed to support core programming constructs such as:

- Variable declarations and assignments (including different data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans)  
- Arithmetic expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)  
- Conditional statements (`lw`, `lw brdo`) to control program flow  
- Looping constructs (`kol_shwaya`) for repeated execution of code blocks  
- Method declarations (`e3ml`) and method calls (`nady 3la`) with parameter passing  
- Expression parsing and evaluation
