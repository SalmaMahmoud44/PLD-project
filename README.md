# PLD_Project ðŸŽ“

This repository contains the project for the **Programming Language Design** course at the Faculty of Computers and Information Sciences (FCIS), Mansoura University.

This project is about creating a **new programming language** inspired by the **Egyptian Arabic dialect** to make it easier to write and understand. The language was **built from scratch** without using tools like **GoldParser**. It supports **basic programming features**, and it's connected to a simple **graphical user interface (GUI)** made with **C#** and **Windows Forms**. The GUI shows both **lexical** and **scientific analysis** of the code.

## Language Features

- **Variable declarations and assignments**  
  Supports different data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

- **Arithmetic expressions**  
  Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Conditional statements**  
  Keywords like `lw`, `lw brdo` are used to control the program flow.

- **Looping constructs**  
  `kol_shwaya` is used for repeating blocks of code.

- **Methods**  
  Use `e3ml` to declare methods and `nady 3la` to call them, with parameter passing.

- **Expression parsing and evaluation**  
  The interpreter can evaluate and analyze expressions written in the language.
